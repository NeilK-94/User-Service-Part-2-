# User-Service-Part-2

This is the second part of a project for a Distributed Systems module.

For part 2 we were required to do two things:

Design a REST API for a User Account web service using OpenAPI and SwaggerHub. The API definition should support the operations listed below while following the REST architectural style and best practices:
• Create a new user
• Get info on a specific user
• Update user details
• Delete a user
• List all users
• Login a user


Develop a User Account service by implementing our API in Java using the Dropwizard microservice framework. Our User Account service should use the password
utility methods provided by the gRPC Password Service we developed in Part 1.
